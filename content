Infograph is a modern tool that can be used for both data visualization and machine learning. Even if the user has no prior knowledge, they can create attractive and informative visualizations, such as graphs and plots. In addition, users can upload their dataset to Infograph to train, test, and make predictions from it. They have the freedom to choose different algorithms and parameters that are best suited for their data. After completing the analysis, they will receive an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report for their dataset.
Infograph's primary goal is to simplify complex tasks and make them accessible to everyone. By simply uploading their dataset and making a few clicks, system can create various types of plots, including scatter plots, bar graphs, bubble plots, box plots, dot plots, pie charts, and more. Infograph also offers several regression and classification algorithms, such as linear, polynomial, and logistic regression.
